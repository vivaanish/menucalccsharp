# 🧮 menucalc

**menucalc** is a simple menu-based calculator built using **C#**. It runs in the console and allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations like **Sum**, **Multiply**, and **Subtract**. For addition, it also gives the option to include a third number. The program keeps running in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

## 📋 Features

- Menu-based interface with 4 options:
  - `1` → Sum (with optional third number)
  - `2` → Multiply
  - `3` → Subtract
  - `4` → Exit
- Uses functions for cleaner logic:
  - `sum(double, double)`
  - `sumThree(double, double, double)`
  - `multiply(double, double)`
  - `subtract(double, double)`
- Loop-based structure to handle continuous user interaction
- Basic input validation using `try-parse` logic (optional to improve)
